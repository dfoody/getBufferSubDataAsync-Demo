# [getBufferSubDataAsync Picking Demo](https://kainino0x.github.io/getBufferSubDataAsync-Demo/)

This demo demonstrates the use of the proposed `getBufferSubDataAsync` method
in WebGL 2 and provides a performance comparison against synchronous picking
methods.

Requires WebGL 2.0 and a patched build of Chromium.

It is based on the Three.js demo
[interactive cubes (gpu)](https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_interactive_cubes_gpu.html).
